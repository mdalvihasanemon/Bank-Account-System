HOW THIS CODE WORK
This code is a basic implementation of a banking system using C++
Header Inclusions: The code includes necessary header files like <iostream> and <string>.

Namespace Declaration: It utilizes the std namespace.

BankAccount Class:

Private Members:
MAX_ACCOUNTS: Constant defining the maximum number of accounts.
Account: Structure defining the account details like number, password, name, and balance.
accounts: An array of Account structures to store multiple accounts.
accountCount: Integer to keep track of the number of accounts.
changeACnumber: Integer to generate unique account numbers.
Public Members:
Constructor BankAccount(): Initializes the accounts with some predefined data using initializeAccounts().
initializeAccounts(): Sets initial account details.
getData(): Entry point for user interaction. It asks if the user has an existing account or wants to create a new one.
getExistingAccountData(): Prompts the user to enter existing account details for authentication.
createNewAccount(): Allows the user to create a new account by providing necessary details.
generateAccountNumber(): Generates a unique account number.
handleTransaction(): Manages different transactions like withdrawal, deposit, transfer, and exit.
deposit(): Allows depositing money into an account.
matchData(): Matches entered account number and password with existing accounts.
withdraw(): Allows withdrawing money from an account.
transfer(): Initiates the transfer process between accounts.
exit(): Exits the program.
Main Function:

Instantiates a BankAccount object and calls getData() to start the banking system.
Flow:

The program starts by asking the user if they have an existing account or not.
If the user has an existing account, it prompts for account number and password for authentication.
If the user doesn't have an account, it allows them to create a new one.
Once authenticated or after creating a new account, the user can perform transactions like withdrawal, deposit, transfer, or exit.
After each transaction, the program returns to the main menu until the user chooses to exit.
Recursive Calls:

Some functions like getData() and deposit() use recursive calls for re-execution when invalid input is provided.
Limitations:

There's no persistent storage for accounts (e.g., file or database), so all data is lost once the program ends.
Error handling is minimal.
Security features are minimal; passwords are stored in plaintext, which is generally not recommended in real-world applications.
